# Happy thoughts Project
This project is about practicing React skills by fetching and posting data to an API while building a Twitter (X)-like project.

### The Problem

I found it quite difficult to figure out how to get this project going.
ChatGPT has been a great resource to have, and the team has a pool of knowledge. I also used YT and Google to find solutions. I even needed to go back to week 5's material to do a recap since I felt so lost at the beginning.  In the end I think this was a fun project and if I had more time I would aim for more of the stretch goals.
